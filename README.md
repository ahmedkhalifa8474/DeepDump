# DeepDump
DeepDump is a comprehensive memory forensics tool designed for incident response and cybersecurity investigations. It combines powerful memory dump analysis with integration of Indicators of Compromise (IoC) feeds, automated anomaly detection, and advanced reporting features. 

Memory Dump Analysis Automation Tool

A Python-based tool for automating memory dump collection, analysis, and reporting. This tool integrates with Volatility, WinPMEM, VirusTotal, and IoC feeds to provide detailed insights into potential anomalies and threats within a system's memory.

Features

Memory Collection

Collects memory dumps using WinPMEM for forensic analysis.

Automated Analysis

Analyzes memory dumps using Volatility plugins:

pslist: Running processes.

dlllist: Loaded DLLs.

cmdscan: Command-line history.

netscan: Network activity.

strings: Searches plain-text strings.

malfind: Detects code injection.

Threat Intelligence Integration

Cross-references findings with:

VirusTotal (file hashes, IPs).

IoC feeds like MISP and AlienVault OTX.

Baseline Comparison

Detects deviations by comparing analysis results with historical baselines.

Reporting

Generates:

CSV Reports: Detailed outputs and anomaly detection.

Visual Graphs: Summary charts for quick insights.

Logging

Maintains an activity log (memory_analysis.log) for troubleshooting and audits.

Installation

Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or later.

Install required Python libraries:


pip install matplotlib requests

Download and set up:

WinPMEM.

Volatility 2.

Clone the Repository


git clone https://github.com/ahmedkhalifa8474/memory-analysis-tool.git

cd memory-analysis-tool

Usage

Configuration

Open the CONFIG dictionary in the script to update:

Paths for WinPMEM and Volatility.

VirusTotal API Key.

IoC feed URLs.

Timeout settings.

Run the Tool


python memory_analysis_tool.py

Outputs

Memory Dump: Saved in the configured output directory (default: C:\MemoryDumpAnalysis).

CSV Report: Report.csv containing analysis results and anomalies.

Visual Chart: Bar graph summarizing key findings (saved as overview_chart.png).

Log File: Detailed log of activities and errors (memory_analysis.log).

Example Workflow

Collect Memory Dump:

Uses WinPMEM to collect a memory image from the endpoint.

Analyze Memory:

Runs Volatility plugins to extract process lists, loaded DLLs, command history, and network activity.

Detect Anomalies:

Compares findings with a baseline to identify new or suspicious processes/DLLs.

Generate Reports:

Creates CSV and visual reports summarizing findings.
Threat Intelligence Lookup:

Matches IoCs (file hashes, IPs) with VirusTotal and IoC feeds for additional context.
